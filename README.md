# Complicated Calculator
 A way to test out Java and improve my ability to create organized code.

## TODOs
1. fix bug where one number is reduced to single digit
2. remove leading zeros
3. generally test new algorithm
4. Finalize calculator CX
5. Use result tracking to not have all math in display at same time
